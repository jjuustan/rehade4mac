How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
First, download or clone the repository to your computer.

2. Make the Script Executable
Make sure the script can run by giving it the necessary permissions.

3. Install Required Tools
Ensure that Wine and other necessary tools like curl, git, grep, and tar are installed on your macOS. You can use Homebrew to install these tools if they aren't already installed.

4. Run the Script
Once everything is set up, run the script to install ReShade on your macOS system.

(Optional) Wrap as a macOS App
If you'd like to create a double-clickable macOS application:

Using Automator: Open Automator, create a new application, add a "Run Shell Script" action, paste the script, and save it as an application.

Using Platypus: Download and install Platypus, create a new project with your script, customize it, and build the application.
